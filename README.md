DREW  (Drawing Routine with Eshkol Wachman) The program provides the means for creating compositions in two dimensions, in which the paths of movements are visible as they create the shapes: so-called ‘motion painting’.  The elements that sweep out these shapes are lines that form a chain (or chains) structurally comparable to groups of articulated axes of the limbs of a moving body. The definitions of the movements are formulated in the terms and concepts of Eshkol Wachman Movement Notation (EWMN). Familiarity with EWMN is an advantage in using this program, but not essential. The program employs the Processing 3 platform.
